# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm **Anshumaan Rajpurohit**

Iâ€™m a developer who enjoys building practical tools and engaging web experiences.  My projects range from Pythonâ€‘based assistants to fullâ€‘stack portfolio sites:

- **Voice assistant & AI tools** â€“ In my `pythonâ€‘projects` repository I build a voiceâ€‘controlled assistant that can recognise speech, detect wake words, send email, retrieve weather, play music, browse the web and even control smartâ€‘home devices.  The assistant can speak multiple languages (including Hindi) and integrates GPT for naturalâ€‘language conversations.
- **French learning bot** â€“ Another part of the same repository is a Telegram bot that sends daily French vocabulary, weekly quizzes and progress reports to help learners practise.
- **Modern portfolio website** â€“ I also created a responsive portfolio site with interactive UI elements, animations, custom cursors and dynamic content loading.  The site is built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and a Python/Flask backend.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

Here are some of the languages and tools I use regularly:

- **Languages** â€“ Python (3.8+), JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML5 & CSS3
- **Frameworks & tools** â€“ Flask, GitHub Actions, OpenAI API, Telegram Bot API
- **Interests** â€“ Natural language processing, voice interfaces, educational bots, responsive web design

## ðŸŒŸ Featured projects

| Project | Highlights |
|--------|-----------|
| **Voice assistant** | Voice recognition & TTS, wakeâ€‘word detection, email sending, weather updates, music control, web browsing, smartâ€‘home control and GPTâ€‘powered conversations. |
| **French learning bot** | Sends daily vocabulary with examples, weekly quizzes and progress tracking via Telegram. |
| **Portfolio website** | Responsive design, animated UI, custom cursor & scrolling effects, dynamic content loading and a Flaskâ€‘powered contact form. |

You can explore these projects in my repositories.

## ðŸ“ˆ GitHub stats & activity

GitHub provides some handy widgets to show your activity.  Once you create a profile README, you can embed these cards to display your statistics.  For example, you might use the following markdown (replace `CLOVER-LOVES` with your username if you change it):

```markdown
![Anshumaan's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=CLOVER-LOVES&show_icons=true&theme=radical)
![Top languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=CLOVER-LOVES&layout=compact)
```

The first image shows your overall contributions and stars, while the second summarises the programming languages used in your public repositories.

## ðŸšª Tips for a standout profile

- **Pin your best projects** â€“ GitHub allows pinning repositories on your profile.  Pin your Python Projects collection and your portfolio website so visitors immediately see your favourite work.
- **Add badges and links** â€“ Include badges for tools (e.g., Python version, GitHub actions) and links to your deployed portfolio or contact pages.  The `python-projects` README already uses badges for licence and Python version; you can reuse similar badges here.
- **Keep it up to date** â€“ Update your profile README as you build new projects or learn new skills.  A fresh profile shows active engagement.
- **Use visuals wisely** â€“ You can embed GIFs, images or even an animated banner to convey personality.  Just keep load times reasonable.

Feel free to customise the sections above to reflect your unique personality and goals.  A wellâ€‘crafted profile README can help you present yourself to the openâ€‘source community and potential collaborators.
